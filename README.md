# videoOfTheDay

This is a project to create a website that shows a video of the day.  The videos will be randomly selected from a list of YouTube channels, which will be weighted toward the STEM field.

Repository is pretty unorganized, may add folders to clean it up.

Site: dailyvideo.io

Purpose: test case to try out github actions and a mini 'full-stack' dev project.  Front-end was not the focus.
